# Turing Machine
- This is a Turing Machine developed in C++ as an assignment for Advanced C++ Programming class.
- Turing Machine is a theoretical computational model that manipulates symbols on a tape according to a set of rules to perform any algorithmic process.

## Mechanism of Turing Machine
- **Table**: Manages the set of transitions/rules that dictate how the Turing machine processes symbols based on the current state and symbol read.
- **Tape**: Represents the tape of the Turing machine, storing symbols and providing methods to read from and write to the tape.
- **Machine**: Controls the operation of the Turing machine, coordinating the states, tape, and transitions to simulate the machine's processing steps.
